That means: it should be used in discotheques                 to supplement the music with matching visuals. </p>              <p>This intention had some influence on the kind of visuals you                 can produce with the program.<br>                Because it's designed to be used live and interactively, there                 is no timeline or a similar concept integrated, which makes it                 difficult to tell a story.<br>                But you can design and display abstract scenes (collections of                 objects in 3d space) and interactively animate them to match the                 rhythm of the music. You can change in real-time almost every                 attribute (color, texture, transformation, lighting, etc. ) of                 the objects in your pre-designed scenes.<br>                <br>                Your computer's keyboard serves as the equivalent to the DJ's                 mixer. Using the mouse enables you to do the visual equivalent                 to 'scratching'.</p>            </blockquote>            <p><b>3D OpenGLego visuals constructor</b>            <blockquote>              <p>You may use kodisein to create and explore new design ideas.                 After creating a static prototype you could use the animation                 feature to explore the parameter space of various attributes to                 optimize the overall design.</p>            </blockquote>            <p><b>Graphical Programming</b>             <blockquote>               <p>The program is essentially a graphical wrapper for a small subset                 of the OpenGL interface. In other words: by using kodisein you                 are graphically constructing a small 'program' which will later                 be interpreted and translated to function calls of the <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a>                 library. </p>              <p>This abstract view opens a lot of possibilities for further usage                 of the program. You could maybe use it to test some aspects of                 your OpenGL engine or do a rapid prototype of an idea you have                 without the necessity to write and compile a program.</p>            </blockquote>            <h2><a name="whatisitnot"></a>What is it not?</h2>            <p><b>First of all: it is not stable!</b>             <blockquote>               <p>The program is still in alpha stadium: there are some known bugs                 and many of the features are unfinished or unpolished. <br>                You should know that it comes with no warranty whatsoever. </p>              <p>Furthermore, the XML format of the project files is very likely                 to change, so the files you might create with this version most                 probably won't work in future versions without some editing by                 hand. </p>              <p>Don't tell me, you haven't been warned ;-)</p>            </blockquote>            <p><b>It is not easy to use!</b>             <blockquote>               <p>As mentioned above, kodisein has some resemblance with a graphical                 programming language and therefore it will take some time to know                 how to use it. </p>              <p>It will be easier if you have a basic understanding of Computer                 Graphics and the underlying mathematics in general and OpenGL                 in particular. </p>              <p>Because kodisein is hardly comparable to any program you know,                 you should read the <a href="manual/index.html">manual</a> before                 starting to use it.
