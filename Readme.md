## Compilation Tests on macOS
The Xcode proj is too old and cannot be opened anymore.

I went in the linux folder and typed `make`. Fixed a few compilation errors, then launched the executable. Segfault. Maybe because I had to remove a functionality to make app compile on 64bits FS hostsâ€¦ ðŸ¤” Anyway I don't really have the time to investigate more right now...
